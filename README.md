## Lyrix on React Native
This is a singer or musician's tool, which organizes your personal collection of song lyrics and chords. It allows easy access to sets of songs, so that you can easily navigate them while performing publicly.

It still needs to be packaged for deployment onto a mobile device, but works currently when launched in Expo.
